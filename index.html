    <h2>About</h2>
        <p class = "history">My name is Jacob Moreno. I am currently a Full Stack Engineer at Talent Path. 
            I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems (CIS) from the University of Houston (Class of Fall 2017). 
            Combining current technology and soft skills, I seek to enhance the bottom line of my company. 
        Whether alone or in a team, I thrive in a challenging environment and also look to learn something new. During 
    my spare time I enjoy running, reading, watching television, and gaming on my trusty laptop. </p>

            <strong>Running:</strong> Personally, I prefer cardio over strength training. I've dicovered how theraputic it can be for the mind,
            body, and soul!

            <strong>Reading:</strong> Books are great for getting the creative juices flowing. I was always captivated by the scenes,
            characters, and events. Reading really showed me perspectives from a different angle.

           <strong> Watching Television:</strong> Hulu and Netfilx are usually my go-to services for watching shows. I'm especially partial
            towards anime shows.

            <strong>Video games</strong> are my life! Since I was 5, I enjoyed traveling to distant worlds. I met wonderful people, had action-packed adventures,
            and got to push my imagination into places I never would've dreamt. I currently game on my trusty laptop, though I'm not
            partial towards any one gaming platform. Whatever floats your boat!
